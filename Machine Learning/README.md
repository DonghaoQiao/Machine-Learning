# Introduction of Machine Learning  
  
## [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/DonghaoQiao/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Unsupervised%20Learning)  
* [K-Means](https://github.com/DonghaoQiao/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Unsupervised%20Learning/K-Means.py)  
  
## ANN  
* [Perceptron] uses the class labels to update weights  
* [Adaline] uses continuous predicted values to update weights  

## [Tree Based Methods](https://github.com/DonghaoQiao/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/TreeBasedMethodsTimeComparing.ipynb)  
Test several tree based methods with Iris dataset  
* Decision Tree  
* Random Forest  
* AdaBoost  
* XGBoost  
* LightGBM  
* CatBoost
