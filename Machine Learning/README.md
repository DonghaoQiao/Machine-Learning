# Introduction of Machine Learning  
  
## [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/DonghaoQiao/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Unsupervised%20Learning)  
* [K-Means](https://github.com/DonghaoQiao/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Unsupervised%20Learning/K-Means.py)  
  
## [ANN](https://github.com/DonghaoQiao/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Perceptron%26Adaline.py)    
* **Perceptron** uses the class labels to update weights  
* **Adaline** uses continuous predicted values to update weights
